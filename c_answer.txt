=============== Array ========================

1) What happens when array is passed as a pointer in a function. Print the array from the    function.

	Ans : Any changes in called function will affect the data in calling function.

2) What will happen if you try to access a value which is out of array boundary 
	
	Ans : Accessing a value from out of array boundary is an undefined behavior. It 	will give garbage value.

3) What happens if you try to add an element to array which falls outside the boundary.
Example - int A[10], int A[21]=11;

	Ans : Which leads segmentation fault.


7)
	
#include <stdio.h>​
int main() ​
{​
int x[4]={1,3,5,7};​
int i;​
int *ptr;​
for(i = 0; i < 4; ++i) ​
{​
      ptr=&x[i];​
      printf("x[%d] is %d\n",i,*(ptr+i)); ​
}​
       return 0;​
}
What would be the printed?


	Ans : 	x[0] is 1 
		x[1] is 5 
		x[2] is garbage value
		x[3] is garbage value


=========================== Bitwise operator =============================


8) What are different bitwise operators.

	Ans :	&	Bitwise AND
		|	Bitwise OR
		^	Bitwise XOR
		>>	Right shift
		<<	Left shift
		~	ones complement

9) Which bitwise operator is suitable for checking whether a particular bit is on or off

	Ans : & Bitwise AND


============================= Command Line Arguments =======================

19) When do we use command line arguments in a program?

	Ans : 	To control the program from outside by passing a input during 				runtime/execution time.


========= Compilation ===============

20) Explain the different Stages of compilation 

	Ans : 	Preprocessor , Translator, Assembler, Linker are the four stages of 			compilation.

		Preprocessor - Format the .c file into .i format. 
		It expands the header, removes the comments, replace the macros and done
		conditional compilation.
		If any error in preprocessor declaration , in preprocessor stage received 		an compilation error.

		Translator - Format the .i file into .s format.
		Check for any syntax error, if error accurs then returns compilation 			error.

		Assembler - Format the .s file into .o format.
		convert the high level language into low level language(assemply code).
		
		Linker - Generate .output file(executable file)
		Links the dependency files. 
		

21)  When do you get compilation error

	Ans : 	If any error occurs in preprocessor declaration, syntax error and 			undefined declaration during linking.


22) When do you get linking error
 	
	Ans : 	While compiling in linking stage it add every dependency file/variable. If 		the dependent file/variable is not defined/declared then the linker will 		raise error.

23) What is the difference between Segmentation fault and Bus error

	Ans :	Segmentation fault occurs if try to access unauthorized memory location
		Bus error occurs when trying to access the invalid address in CPU memory

24) What happens if the same external variable is declared in multiple c file 

	Ans :	If compiling for single file it wont give error, while linking linker will 		generate the error message multiple declaration of the variable.

25) Why makefile is used?

	Ans : 	To make compilation easy. Makefile helps to build multiple object file and 		target file to compile and we can able to remove them.  

26) What are the different data structure? Do we've datastructure available as a part of   standard library?

	Ans :	Linear data structure - Array , stack, queue, linked list
		Non linear data structure - Graph, tree.

		No we wont have datastructure available as a part of standard library.


=========================== Dynamic Memory Allocation ===============================
		
29) What is dynamic memory allocation and when it is used? 

	Ans : 	Dyanamic memory allocation is used to allocate and deallocate the memory 		in runtime.
		Dynamic memory allocation allocate memory in heap section by using 			standard c library functions(calloc, malloc) and if need extra memory, 			then realloc function is used to reallocate the memory in runtime.

30) What happens if allocated memory is nor freed?

	Ans : Memory leak accurs.

================================== ENUM ===========================================
31) What will happen if you try to print a ENUM by using %s?

	Ans : 	Enum is an user define data type which is used to assign names to integral 		constant. It will leads segmentation error
